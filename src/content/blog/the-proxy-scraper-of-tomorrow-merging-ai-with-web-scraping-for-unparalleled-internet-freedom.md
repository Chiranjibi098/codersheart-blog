### 🤖 Introduction

The internet is an ever-expanding universe, brimming with data, information, and opportunities. But in a world where access is increasingly restricted, proxy scrapers have become the gatekeepers, ensuring anonymity and accessibility. Traditionally, these tools were basic scripts that gathered proxy lists, but as the digital landscape grows more complex, the need for smarter, more adaptable tools is evident. Enter the next generation of proxy scrapers—powered by artificial intelligence and machine learning—designed not just to gather proxies but to analyze, predict, and adapt in real time. 🤖🔍

This blog dives into the architecture of a futuristic proxy scraper, a tool that embodies the cutting edge of technology to navigate the evolving internet. This isn’t just a scraper; it’s a dynamic, AI-driven system that learns and adapts, setting a new standard for proxy scraping. 🌟

### **🔍 Why Proxy Scraping Needs to Evolve**

Proxy scrapers are essential for bypassing geo-restrictions, maintaining anonymity, and ensuring secure connections across the web. However, traditional proxy scrapers face several challenges:

1. **Inconsistent Reliability**: Not all proxies are created equal. Some may be slow, others unreliable, and many might not work at all. 🚫
2. **Static Lists**: Most scrapers work with static lists that quickly become outdated. 📉
3. **Manual Updates**: Updating proxies and maintaining their reliability requires constant manual intervention. 🛠️

The future of proxy scraping lies in automation, intelligence, and adaptability. By integrating AI, we can create a proxy scraper that not only gathers proxies but also evaluates and predicts their reliability, adapting to changes in real-time. 🌐✨

### **🛠️ The Blueprint of a Futuristic Proxy Scraper**

To build this advanced proxy scraper, we’ll leverage Ruby on Rails as the framework, incorporating TensorFlow for machine learning, and Sidekiq for background processing. The goal is to create a scraper that autonomously identifies and ranks proxies, ensuring you always have access to the best available options. 🏆

#### **📂 Step 1: Setting Up the Rails Environment**

Start by setting up a new Rails application and installing the necessary gems:

```
rails new AIProxyScraper
cd AIProxyScraper

# Add necessary gems in Gemfile
gem 'httparty'
gem 'nokogiri'
gem 'tensorflow', '~> 0.3.2'
gem 'sidekiq'

bundle install
```

These gems will enable HTTP requests, HTML parsing, and AI model integration—essential components for our smart scraper. 🔧

#### **🤖 Step 2: Creating the Proxy Model**

We need a database model to store proxies and their AI-predicted reliability scores:

```
rails generate model Proxy ip:string port:integer protocol:string country:string reliability:float
rails db:migrate
```

This model will store crucial information about each proxy, including its IP address, port, protocol, country, and an AI-predicted reliability score. 📈

#### **🧠 Step 3: Integrating AI with TensorFlow**

Here’s where things get exciting. We’ll build a simple AI model using TensorFlow to predict the reliability of proxies based on historical data. The AI model will learn from past interactions to improve its predictions over time.

Create a new service for the AI model:

```
mkdir app/services
touch app/services/proxy_model.rb
```

In `app/services/proxy_model.rb`, add the following code:

```
require 'tensorflow'

class ProxyModel
  def initialize
    @model = TensorFlow::Graph.new
    create_model
  end

  def create_model
    @model.as_default do
      @input = TensorFlow::Placeholder.new(TensorFlow::FLOAT32, shape: [-1, 3])
      @labels = TensorFlow::Placeholder.new(TensorFlow::FLOAT32, shape: [-1, 1])

      dense1 = TensorFlow::Layers::Dense.new(@input, units: 64, activation: :relu)
      dense2 = TensorFlow::Layers::Dense.new(dense1, units: 64, activation: :relu)
      @output = TensorFlow::Layers::Dense.new(dense2, units: 1, activation: :sigmoid)

      @loss = TensorFlow::Losses.mean_squared_error(@labels, @output)
      @optimizer = TensorFlow::Train::AdamOptimizer.new(learning_rate: 0.001).minimize(@loss)
    end
  end

  def train(input_data, label_data, epochs = 1000)
    input_tensor = TensorFlow::Tensor.new(input_data)
    label_tensor = TensorFlow::Tensor.new(label_data)

    epochs.times do
      _, loss_value = @optimizer.run(@input => input_tensor, @labels => label_tensor)
      puts "Training Loss: #{loss_value}" if epochs % 100 == 0
    end
  end

  def predict(input_data)
    input_tensor = TensorFlow::Tensor.new(input_data)
    @output.run(@input => input_tensor)
  end
end
```

This AI model is the brain behind our proxy scraper. It takes in data (IP address, port, protocol) and outputs a reliability score, helping to weed out unreliable proxies before they’re used. 🧠🔍

#### **🌐 Step 4: Building the Proxy Scraper**

Now, we’ll build the actual scraper, integrating it with our AI model to evaluate proxies on the fly:

```
touch app/services/proxy_scraper.rb
```

In `app/services/proxy_scraper.rb`, add the following code:

```
require 'httparty'
require 'nokogiri'

class ProxyScraper
  BASE_URL = "https://www.sslproxies.org/"  # Example proxy list website

  def initialize
    @model = ProxyModel.new
  end

  def scrape_proxies
    response = HTTParty.get(BASE_URL)
    parsed_page = Nokogiri::HTML(response.body)

    parsed_page.css('table tbody tr').each do |row|
      ip = row.css('td')[0].text.strip
      port = row.css('td')[1].text.strip.to_i
      protocol = row.css('td')[6].text.strip.downcase
      country = row.css('td')[3].text.strip

      reliability = predict_reliability(ip, port, protocol)
      if reliability > 0.5  # Example threshold
        Proxy.create(ip: ip, port: port, protocol: protocol, country: country, reliability: reliability)
      end
    end
  end

  def predict_reliability(ip, port, protocol)
    input_data = [[ip_to_numeric(ip), port, protocol_to_numeric(protocol)]]
    result = @model.predict(input_data)
    result[0][0]
  end

  private

  def ip_to_numeric(ip)
    ip.split('.').map(&:to_i).inject(0) { |a, b| (a << 8) + b }
  end

  def protocol_to_numeric(protocol)
    case protocol
    when 'http'
      1
    when 'https'
      2
    else
      0
    end
  end
end
```

This scraper dynamically fetches proxies, evaluates them using the AI model, and stores only the most reliable ones in the database. It’s a smart, automated solution that ensures your proxy list is always up-to-date and effective. 🚀🔒

#### **⏲️ Step 5: Automating Proxy Testing**

To keep the proxy list fresh, we’ll automate the process of testing and updating proxies using Sidekiq. This ensures that the AI model continues to learn and adapt over time:

```
rails generate job proxy_test
```

In `app/jobs/proxy_test_job.rb`, add:

```
class ProxyTestJob < ApplicationJob
  queue_as :default

  def perform
    scraper = ProxyScraper.new
    scraper.scrape_proxies

    proxies = Proxy.all
    proxies.each do |proxy|
      response_time = test_proxy(proxy.ip, proxy.port)
      label = response_time < 1.0 ? 1 : 0  # 1 for reliable, 0 for unreliable
      scraper.train([[proxy.ip, proxy.port, proxy.protocol]], [[label]])
    end
  end

  def test_proxy(ip, port)
    # Simulate a test to check proxy response time
    start_time = Time.now
    HTTParty.get("http://example.com", http_proxyaddr: ip, http_proxyport: port)
    Time.now - start_time
  end
end
```

This job periodically runs, scraping new proxies, testing them, and feeding the results back into the AI model, which continues to improve and refine its predictions. 🕒🔄

#### **🌍 Step 6: Integrating with the Rails App**

To make this scraper accessible, we’ll add routes and a controller to trigger it:

```
rails generate controller Proxies
```

In `app/controllers/proxies_controller.rb`, add:

```
class ProxiesController < ApplicationController
  def scrape
    ProxyTestJob.perform_now
    redirect_to proxies_path, notice: "Proxies scraped and tested successfully."
  end

  def index
    @proxies = Proxy.all
  end
end
```

Add routes in `config/routes.rb`:

```
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  resources :proxies, only: [:index] do
    collection do
      get 'scrape'
    end


  end

  root "proxies#index"
end
```

#### **👁️ Step 7: Displaying Results**

Finally, create a simple view to display the proxies and their reliability scores:

In `app/views/proxies/index.html.erb`:

```
<h1>Scraped Proxies</h1>
<%= link_to "Scrape Proxies", scrape_proxies_path, class: "btn btn-primary" %>

<table class="table">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>IP</th>
      <th>Port</th>
      <th>Protocol</th>
      <th>Country</th>
      <th>Reliability</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <% @proxies.each do |proxy| %>
      <tr>
        <td><%= proxy.ip %></td>
        <td><%= proxy.port %></td>
        <td><%= proxy.protocol %></td>
        <td><%= proxy.country %></td>
        <td><%= proxy.reliability %></td>
      </tr>
    <% end %>
  </tbody>
</table>
```

### **🚀 Running the Application**

With everything set up, start your Rails server and navigate to `http://localhost:3000/proxies/scrape` to begin scraping proxies and testing their reliability.

```
rails server
```
