# Pattern Programs in C

In this blog, we will explore five interesting pattern programs in C. These programs utilize loops and conditional statements to create various number patterns based on user input. Let's dive into each program and understand how they work, along with example outputs.

## 1. Inverted Right-Angled Triangle

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    int i, j, l, n;
    printf("Enter a number: ");
    scanf("%d", &n);
    for (i = n; i >= 1; i--) {
        for (l = 1; l <= n - i; l++)
            printf(" ");
        for (j = i; j <= 2 * i - 1; j++)
            printf("%d", j);
        printf("\n");
    }
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation
This program prints an inverted right-angled triangle pattern of numbers. The outer loop iterates from `n` down to `1`, controlling the number of rows. The first inner loop prints spaces for formatting, and the second inner loop prints the numbers starting from `i` up to `2*i - 1`.

### Example Output
```
Enter a number: 5
56789
 4567
  345
   23
    1
```

## 2. Pyramid of Numbers

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    int i, j, k, l, n;
    printf("Enter a number: ");
    scanf("%d", &n);
    for (i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        l = 1;
        for (k = 1; k <= n - i; k++)
            printf(" ");
        for (j = 1; j <= 2 * i - 1; j++) {
            printf("%d", l);
            if (j < i)
                l++;
            else
                l--;
        }
        printf("\n");
    }
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation
This program prints a pyramid pattern where the numbers increase to the middle and then decrease. The outer loop iterates from `1` to `n`, while the first inner loop manages the spaces. The second inner loop prints the numbers, increasing until the midpoint and decreasing afterward.

### Example Output
```
Enter a number: 5
    1
   121
  12321
 1234321
123454321
```

## 3. Inverted Pyramid with Descending Numbers

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    int i, j, k, l, n;
    printf("Enter a number: ");
    scanf("%d", &n);
    for (i = n; i >= 1; i--) {
        l = n - i + 1;
        for (k = 1; k <= l - 1; k++)
            printf(" ");
        for (j = 1; j <= 2 * i - 1; j++) {
            printf("%d", l);
            if (j < i)
                l++;
            else
                l--;
        }
        printf("\n");
    }
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation
This program produces an inverted pyramid pattern with descending numbers. The outer loop iterates from `n` to `1`, determining the number of rows. The first inner loop prints leading spaces, while the second inner loop controls the number output, similar to the previous pyramid pattern but starting from `l`.

### Example Output
```
Enter a number: 5
54321
 4444
  333
   22
    1
```

## 4. Inverted Pyramid with Ascending Numbers

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    int i, j, k, l, n;
    printf("Enter a number: ");
    scanf("%d", &n);
    for (i = n; i >= 1; i--) {
        l = 1;
        for (k = 1; k <= n - i; k++)
            printf(" ");
        for (j = 1; j <= 2 * i - 1; j++) {
            printf("%d", l);
            if (j < i)
                l++;
            else
                l--;
        }
        printf("\n");
    }
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation
This program also prints an inverted pyramid, but it displays `1`s in the first column and increases the number with each step to the center before decreasing. The structure of the loops is similar to the previous patterns.

### Example Output
```
Enter a number: 5
11111
 2222
  333
   44
    5
```

## 5. Diamond Pattern with Spaces

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    int i, j, l, k, n;
    printf("Enter a number: ");
    scanf("%d", &n);
    for (i = n; i >= 1; i--) {
        l = 1;
        k = i;
        for (j = 1; j <= 2 * n - 1; j++) {
            if (l <= i)
                printf("%d", l);
            else
                printf(" ");

            if (j < n)
                l++;
            else
                l--;
        }
        printf("\n");
    }
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation
This program creates a diamond-like shape where the numbers start from `1` and increment outward, then decrement back to `1`. The outer loop iterates from `n` down to `1`, while the inner loops manage the spacing and number printing.

### Example Output
```
Enter a number: 5
12345
 1234
  123
   12
    1
```
