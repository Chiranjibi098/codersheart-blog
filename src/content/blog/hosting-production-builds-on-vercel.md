## How Vercel Works

### Build and Deployment

When you push changes to your Git repository, Vercel automatically detects the changes and triggers a new build. Vercel uses a build pipeline to compile your code, generate static assets, and prepare your project for deployment.

### CDN and Edge Network

Vercel deploys your project to its global edge network, ensuring fast load times by serving content from the nearest CDN node to your users.

### Serverless Functions

Vercel allows you to create serverless functions that run on-demand. These functions can handle backend logic, interact with databases, and more, without the need for traditional server management.

### Monitoring and Analytics

Vercel provides real-time logs and analytics, allowing you to monitor your project's performance and track user interactions.

## Conclusion

Vercel is a powerful platform that simplifies the process of deploying and hosting web applications. With its seamless integration with popular frontend frameworks and Git providers, Vercel enables developers to focus on building great user experiences without worrying about infrastructure.
